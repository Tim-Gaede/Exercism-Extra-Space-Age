# Space Age

Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:

   - Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
   - Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
   - Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
   - Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
   - Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
   - Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
   - Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
   - Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should
be able to say that they're 31.69 Earth-years old.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`throw("Error")`, you should write:

```julia
throw("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```
## Version compatibility

This exercise has been tested on Julia 1.2.
